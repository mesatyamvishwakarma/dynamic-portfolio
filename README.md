# 📌 Introduction

Dynamic Portfolio helps you create simple websites by merely filling out forms. This helps remove the burden of writing hundreds of lines of code, or the financial loss of paying a professional website developer to create your website for you.

The website aims to provide several templates, each catering to the user's individual needs, both in light and dark mode.

At present, there are three templates for the users to work with.

[Template 1 - Student Portfolio](https://dynamic--portfolio.vercel.app/portfolio/630f44611ddb0f899c66e399)

[Template 2 - Photographer Portfolio](https://dynamic--portfolio.vercel.app/portfolio/630f51c81ddb0f899c66e39a)

[Template 3 - Designer/Writer Portfolio](https://dynamic--portfolio.vercel.app/portfolio/638e3ff00640c1002987cc1e)

MVP is completed **This is an Ongoing Project**.
